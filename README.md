I am a cybersecurity student at the Rey Juan Carlos University in Madrid, Spain. I have developed a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems.

## Objective

In order to grasp some of the profound world of cibersecurity, I invest my free time in developing projects and tools that can be applied to cibersecurity. I also participate in CTFs, so if I find any challenge specially interesting I will post my writeup.

## Projects

### Completed projects
- <a href="https://github.com/dreysanox/ToolSave"> ToolSave</a>:
ToolSave is a python terminal tool that helps you save weird or unique commands that you know you will need in the future, and when you do, you dont want to go scouring the whole web for them. It saves everything in json format, so that the files can be easily transfered and used on any other machine.

### Projects in the making
